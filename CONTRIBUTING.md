## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct

Please read and follow the [Code of Conduct](WIP).

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

If you have a question or need help, you can ask in the discussion tab.

> Please, do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.


## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can report it in a issue.
If you would like to *fix* it, please open a issue first.


## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search if a similar issue already exists. In this case, you can upvote with üëç the existing issue to help to prioritize issues.

> Please, don't write "+1" comment. It is difficult to count them, so only üëç will be taken into consideration.


### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

You can submit a pull request by following this guidelines:

1. Submit a issue by following [the below guidelines]((#submit-issue)). Discussing upfront helps to ensure that the fix/feature can be accepted.
2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository.
3. In the forked repository, make the changes in a new git branch
4. Modify the code, **including appropriate test cases**.
5. Follow our [Coding Rules](#rules).
6. Create a pull request to the branch `main`.
7. The team will review the pull request and merge.
8. A huge thank you for your participation.


TODO : Adapt next

## <a name="rules"></a> Coding Rules
To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).
* All public API methods **must be documented**.
* We follow [Google's TypeScript Style Guide][ts-style-guide], but wrap all code at **100 characters**.

   An automated formatter is available, see [DEVELOPER.md](contributing-docs/building-and-testing-angular.md#formatting-your-source-code).


## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted:
```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

See [Commit Message Guidelines](wip) for details.
